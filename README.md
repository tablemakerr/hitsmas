# Hitsmas

A (very unofficial) Python version of Giant Bomb's popular Hitsmas game mode for the recent Hitman games.  Ideally this simple python script should work for any newer version of python3 out of the box.  Further testing of that claim required.  The idea is to just launch the script with the flags that appeal to you and the script will return how your Hitman contract should go!


## Getting Started

Download or clone or copy&paste or whatever method you have for getting this script onto your system in a runnable fashion.

### Prerequisites

This should work on any Windows, Linux, or Mac system with Python3.  Python2 is not recommended and I'm pretty sure some ways that I manipulate things just don't work in Python2

## Examples

### Use Map France with Bombastic rules for 1 Player:

```
python ./hitsmas.py -m 1 -b
REMEMBER!  These are Illusive Target rules.
If you fail to assassinate your target in the given way, die, or target escapes, you LOSE!

Map:            Paris, France

Player 1
Target:         Viktor Novikov
DISGUISE:       Crew Member
WEAPON:         Any Explosive

Target:         Dalia Margolis
DISGUISE:       Chef
WEAPON:         Screwdriver

WILDCARD:       Set Off Explosion In Runway

!! Bombastic rules in play.  You may choose a smuggled item
```
### Use Map Sapienza with Long Island rules for 3 Players
